# VSCode Example project

This project is designed to present how a coding project can be configured and edited using Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
It serves as a practical example, demonstrating various features and settings that can be utilized within the VSCode
environment.

One of the key features highlighted in this project is the VSCode workspace. A workspace in VSCode is a collection of
related files and folders that allows you to organize and manage your project effectively. It provides a centralized
location for storing project-specific settings, extensions, and configurations. By using workspaces, you can easily
switch between different projects (dynamic interpreter change) and maintain separate settings for each project.

The purpose of this project is not only to demonstrate the capabilities of VSCode as an editor but also to provide a
hands-on approach to learning how to effectively configure and manage a coding project within this environment.
Whether you're a seasoned developer or a beginner just starting out, this project aims to provide valuable insights
into the workings of VSCode and its many features.
